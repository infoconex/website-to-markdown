I was recently tasked with putting together a ping and traceroute feature in an application and like I always do I googled to see if someone had already worked out how to do this.

I found a few people who had posted ICMP libraries and so I used one of them and tested and everything seemed to work properly. However I was getting reports that it was not working on Vista. However the person could use the built in ping and tracert utilities with no issue.

At first I thought it might be related to permissions or firewall but none of those ended up resolving the issue.

So I fired up wireshark and looked at what was different at the packet level between what I was doing and what the built in windows ping was doing.

The code I was using was returning an incorrect checksum on the ICMP reply. So I searched a bit to learn about the checksum and ended up finding somehow that as of .NET 2.0 framework there is a Ping class built into the framework!!

So I am posting this in hopes of saving someone a bunch of time with the same issue I had. Also the code I had to put together initially was much more complex. This I think you will see is very straight forward.

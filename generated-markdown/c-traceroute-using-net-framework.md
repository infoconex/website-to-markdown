If you have ever tried to create a traceroute program using one of the few available ICMP libraries freely available for C# you may have run into some issues mainly to do with the ICMP checksum not being correct. It seems that as of .NET 2.0 framework that microsoft included a Ping class that makes it really easy to then use it to create a traceroute utility. Here is some basic code to create a traceroute utility.

```csharp
public string Traceroute(string ipAddressOrHostName)

{

    IPAddress ipAddress = Dns.GetHostEntry(ipAddressOrHostName).AddressList[0];

    StringBuilder traceResults = new StringBuilder();


    using(Ping pingSender = new Ping())

    {

        PingOptions pingOptions = new PingOptions();

        Stopwatch stopWatch = new Stopwatch();

        byte[] bytes = new byte[32];


        pingOptions.DontFragment = true;

        pingOptions.Ttl = 1;

        int maxHops = 30;


        traceResults.AppendLine(

            string.Format(

                "Tracing route to {0} over a maximum of {1} hops:",

                ipAddress,

                maxHops));


        traceResults.AppendLine();


        for(int i = 1; i < maxHops + 1; i++)

        {

            stopWatch.Reset();

            stopWatch.Start();

            PingReply pingReply = pingSender.Send(

                ipAddress,

                5000,

                new byte[32], pingOptions);


            stopWatch.Stop();


            traceResults.AppendLine(

                string.Format("{0}\t{1} ms\t{2}",

                i,

                stopWatch.ElapsedMilliseconds,

                pingReply.Address));


            if(pingReply.Status == IPStatus.Success)

            {

                traceResults.AppendLine();

                traceResults.AppendLine("Trace complete."); break;

            }


            pingOptions.Ttl++;

        }


    }


    return traceResults.ToString();

}
```

```

```
